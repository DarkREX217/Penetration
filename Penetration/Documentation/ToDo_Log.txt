About:  Document Description.
     This log tracks my list of things to do for the Penetration Project.  I 
need to decide if this is going to be an unchanging historical log, or an up to 
date check list of things that still need to be done.


<< Some sort of "How To Read This Document" type of section may be inserted 
here>>

		
To Do:

- Create a GUI based run file that is able to provide menu options and run the 
  game.
      + Player Loading System (Upper Right of main menu)
          * Create a new Player with name
	      * Load Player
		      > Display a list of existing Players to choose from, clicking 
			    Player will select it, double click will load.
		  * View some Player stats: Highest completed Level, kills, deaths, etc.
              ? Create Ranking system to make Players feel special about their 
                achievements?			 
      + Options
          * Audio / Visual
              > Full screen with key binding / Allow resizable screen / Etc.
              > Toggle captions			
          * Controls
              > Fully editable keybindings listing		  
	  + Set Up Penetration (Better name?)
	      * Begin New Game
		  * Load Game
		  * Level Select
	  $ Assets
	      * Images
		      - Main Menu background image with pretty Penetration banner.
			  - Cool theme for all the controls and fonts
		  * Audio 
		      - Background music
			  - Cursor movements, clicks, significant selections
	      * Media
		      - Cool Processing animation / effect that goes with the theme. Ex:
			    Matrix like code scrambeling across the screen, etc.
			  - REXWare Logo
			  -	Opening cut sceen
		 
		
- Work on the Inventory
      + Fix how Player's HUD is displayed, may include creating new class
      + Create workable Iventory to display, making it pretty will come later.

- Create some Items
      + Health extender - instant use
      + Keycard
	  + Body armor - instant use
	  + Distraction
	  + Batteries
	  + Night Vision Goggels (see Lighting section)

- Create Weapons
      + Unarmed / Knife
      + Pistol / Silencer
      +	AK-47
      + Sniper Rifle
      + EMP / Jammer
	  + Tazer
	  + Stun gernades
	  
- Create Doors / Switches

- Create a goal / finish point for a Level

- Create Pause Menu

- Figure out how I'm going to handle a Camera object

- Look into creating a PlayerControler to handle input	  

- Look into how to incorporate cutsceens
      + Pre-rendered media files with captions
	  + Scripted in game sequences
		
- Enemies
      + AI
	      * Fix tracking, allow for smooth direction angle adjusting
		  * Firing Weapon logic
		  * Following preset path (This is more for the Level's sake)
		      > Enemies already have the code to go from Waypoint to Waypoint in
			    Mortal, I need a system in Level that keeps track of the 
				different PatrolPath's an Enemy can make
		  * Unconsious, Stunned, PathMode, CautionMode, AlertMode		
      + Enemy Types
	      * Stationary
		      > Security Camera
			  > Auto turret
	      * Path Following
		      > Gaurd
			  > 
		  * Boss / Objective
		
- Lighting
      +  Allow for dark areas
          * When you are in the dark, the draw method blacks out everything out
            of your range of sight, and slightly darkens things on the 
			perimeter.  When you put on night vision in the dark, the whole 
			screen flashes bright green, and gradually shifts to almost normal
            color.  If you put on night vision in the light, the screen flashes
            white, you get the classic ringing sound, and the player gets 
			stunned.  The player can see as soon as you take them off, but the
            Player will still be stunned till it wears off.
